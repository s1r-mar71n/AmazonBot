# ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€ Amazon Bot ðŸš€ðŸš€ðŸš€

### How to use: 

1. clone this repository and extract it
2. head over to AmazonBot/content_script.js and configure the desired prices and items in priceObject: 

Instructions on how to do that: 
Any number of items can be put into this json-object (priceObject), its syntax is "key" : value, "key" : value, ...
The key should be taken from the items title, for example if we visit https://www.amazon.de/MSI-RTX-3070-Gaming-Trio/dp/B08LNPPCWJ the items "key" is "MSI RTX 3070 Gaming X Trio". 
So if you want to configure your bot in order to buy this card at 800â‚¬ or lower, you would build a json-object like this: 

{
    "MSI RTX 3070 Gaming X Trio": 800,
    "any other item" : 1337
}

3. Save your configuration and head over to chrome and visit chrome://extensions
4. Choose "Load unpacked" in the left top corner and navigate to the folder "AmazonBot"

### Congrats! You did it. 

Now all you need to do is open all the tabs for those items & prices, that you configured in step 2. 

If you want to use amazon normally again, you need to disable the extension!
